Created and made the navbar black.
Did the migration thing with the /admin page and changed the text on it.    

        ***Templates inheritance***
- created a file base.html
- copied all the context of index.html into it. (earlier html part and the navbar component of the bootstrap)
- added title and body blocks to the base.html
- extended the index.html page with the base.html. added the tile and body block content to it.
- did the same with about, contacts and services.
- modify the views.py file with the render function.

  *** List template ***
- go to bootstrap home page -> doc->components -> list group ->costum content. Copy the code.
- in index.html, in body block add a div container. Inside it add the paste the template code. 
- give margin with my-5 to the div container.
- the first one is in blue color which will be the heading of the list.
- The rest will be the questions of the list inside anchor <a>.
- Change the text accordingly and add the hyperlink of the page you want it to forward to.
- make container-fluid to extend it to the whole page.


    *** working on the database ***
    *creating form in contacts.html*

- go to doc->form->layout->choose the second form. 
- create a div container in contacts.html and paste the form. 
- in the form<> add method = 'post' and type the action to be for /contacts 
- in mail, type='text', name='email', id='email', placeholder='type your email.'
- in one of the class division use textarea and row = 3.
- csrf token is used so that the data isn't sent by the user in any unethical way. It helps in receiving a new form every time of submission.
- After this the submitted response will go to the contacts() in views now.

- created a class contacts in models.py for the fields created above.
class Contacts(models.Model):
    email=models.CharField(max_length=122)
    password=models.models.CharField(max_length=122)
    name=models.CharField(max_length=12)
    desc=models.models.TextField()
    date=models.models.DateField()
- updated the contacts function in views.py
def contacts(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        name = request.POST.get('name')
        email = request.POST.get('email')
        phone = request.POST.get('phone')
        desc = request.POST.get('desc')
        contact = Contacts(name = name, email = email, phone = phone, desc = desc, date = datetime.today())
        contact.save()
    return render(request, 'contacts.html')
- for our table to be detected there are two things we'll need to do:
    1. Register the table(class created) in admin.py
    2. Add the name of the app(with the directory) in the settings.py file from home/apps.py file. e.g home.apps.HomeConfig
- try detecting migrations with makemigrations.
- now the changes made in the files have been recorded in one file.
- to create table out of this information we need to run the migrate command.
- now every entry we fill in the form is being saved in the database and can be checked by /admin page.
- if we want our entries to appear with the person's name who filled it we'll have to add one more function to the class we created:
class Contacts(models.Model):
    email=models.CharField(max_length=122)
    phone=models.CharField(max_length=122)
    name=models.CharField(max_length=12)
    desc=models.TextField()
    date=models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

- in /admin you can update or add new entries.

      **sql queries from shell**
- from home.models import Contacts
- Contacts.objects.all()
- Contacts.objects.all()[0]
- Contacts.objects.all().first()
- Contacts.objects.all().last()

- Contacts.objects.filter(name='amit', phone='23423')
- Contacts.objects.filter(name='amit')[0]
- Contacts.objects.filter(name='amit')[0].email
- update:
  inst = Contacts.objects.filter(name='amit')[0]
  inst.phone = '999999'
  inst.save()
